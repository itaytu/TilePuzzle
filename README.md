<p><strong>Tile Puzzle</strong></p>
<p>In this project, I've implemented a simple project to simulate a Tile Puzzle game.<br />I tried to use an event-based-architecture model and simulation for the program combined with the OOP paradigm.</p>
<p><strong>Game steps:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>First, the player chooses a valid integer to initialize the board size.</li>
<li>Each round the player can make a move according to the available moves for that round.</li>
<li>The game is over when the player wins the game or decides to quit.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>
<p>The possible moves are:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>U - up.</li>
<li>D - down.</li>
<li>R - right.</li>
<li>L - left.</li>
<li>Q - quit the game.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How to run:</strong></p>
<p>First, you'll need Java installed on your machine. Follow&nbsp;this <a href="https://www.java.com/en/download/help/download_options.html">guide</a> to install java if you don't already have it.</p>
<p>Choose from the following options.</p>
<ol>
<li>Download the project to your machine and Run jar file (Faster method)&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>open the command prompt.</li>
<li>navigate to the downloaded folder.</li>
<li>run the following command to start the applications:&nbsp;</li>
<li>
<blockquote>java -jar TilePuzzle.jar</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Open an IDE of your choice (works best with IntelliJ).
<ul>
<li>import project from remote version control.</li>
<li>Choose a target directory on your machine for the project.</li>
<li>A window will pop asking if you'd like to open the pom.xml file - click Yes.</li>
<li>To run the program navigate to src -> main -> java -> client -> Main java class</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
